    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>We make monthly contributions for you. Tell us which organizations you want to support and how much to charge your credit card. We use <a href="https://stripe.com">stripe</a> to store your information securely.</p>
    <p>Donations aren't tax-deductible for now, but we are working on that.</p>
    <p>We also ask that you give us an optional $5 tip to help with our operations.</p>
